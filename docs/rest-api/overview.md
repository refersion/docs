# REST API Overview

!!! Important
    This is a legacy API. Going forward, we will slowly work to migrate clients over to our new GraphQL API in order to prevent interruptions.

The Refersion API is organized around REST, which is easily accessible using most modern programming languages. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. In addition, valid JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.
