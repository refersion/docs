            "text": "Welcome to Refersion\n\n\nThank you for being a part of the Refersion developer community.  This isn't a simple referral tracking system.  Refersion is the most powerful Affiliate Program available and it is waiting for \nyou\n to unlock that power.  With the \nGraphQL API\n, the entire database of information is at your fingertips.  You can track things, generate reports, and view all of the data Refersion has for your Affiliate program. \n\n\nThere are three parts of the Refersion system.  The first is the \nTracking Documentation\n.  The Tracking Document shows you how to setup refersion  If you follow the link above for the Tracking Documentation, you will learn how to include the Javascript code on your pages, insert your API keys, and track visists.\n\n\nThe second part of the system is the \nREST\n API.  This API allows you to access functions, creating new customers, etc.  REST is easily accessible using most modern programming languages.  Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-orientated URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API eerrors.  In addition, valid \nJSON\n will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.  Please refer to our \nAPI docs\n for additional information.  It will have the latest documentation for all end points as the Refersion API is revised over time.\n\n\nThe third part of the system is \nGraphQL\n.  GraphQL allows you view all of the data inside of the database.  The entire database of information is available to you.  See the \nOverview\n section below for additional information.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe Refersion GraphQL API allows you to query your dataset of affiliate activity through a unified interface.  You don't have to depend on Refersion creating the insight from the data, you can mine the dataset for exactly what you need.\n\n\nWhat is GraphQL?\n\n\nGraphQL is a new way to think about building and querying APIs. Rather than construct several REST requests to fetch data that you\u2019re interested in, you can often make a single call to fetch the information you need. Additionally you can specify exactly which fields you want included in the response.\n\n\nGraphQL is, above all, a querying language, and the format of the query you send matches the data you receive. The language has a schema that strongly types the exchange between client and server.\n\n\nRunning Queries\n\n\nGraphQL is hierarchical. Fields between curly braces \u2013 which are also at the next level of indent \u2013 are part of the enclosing type. For example, \nid\n and \nemail\n are fields available as part of the \naffiliate\n type and \ncommission\n is a part of offer.\n\n\nWhy GraphQL\n\n\nWe\u2019re supporting GraphQL because it offers much more flexibility than a traditional \nREST\n interface. GraphQL natively supports performing an introspection query which allows the API to more fully discoverable and easier to integrate against. The ability to define and specify precisely the data you want for your integration is a powerful advantage over the existing REST endpoints. Through fragments and template variables it simplifies many aspects of the client-side integration process. Additionally, because it\u2019s a recognized spec, there are many client libraries and tools to assist you in quickly getting up and running.\n\n\nAditional Resources\n\n\nBelow is some optional reading material that might help you go deeper into the GraphQL ecosystem:\n\n\n\n\nGraphQL Specification\n\n\nIntroduction to GraphQL\n\n\nThe Fullstack Tutorial for GraphQL\n\n\nList of GraphQL Tools\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nIn order to make API requests, you will need an active Refersion account.  You can start your free trial account \nhere\n or you can email \nhelpme@refersion.com\n for more details. \n\n\nBase URL\n\n\nAll URLS referenced in the documentation have the following base:\n\n\nhttps://graphql.refersion.com\n\n\n\n\n\nSSL/HTTPS\n\n\nThe Refersion GraphQL API is serveed over HTTPS.  To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nIn order to make calls to our API you need to include your API key along with the request.

Refersion is the most powerful Affiliate Program available and it is waiting for  you  to unlock that power.  With the  GraphQL API , the entire database of information is at your fingertips.  You can track things, generate reports, and view all of the data Refersion has for your Affiliate program.   There are three parts of the Refersion system.  The first is the  Tracking Documentation .  The Tracking Document shows you how to setup refersion  If you follow the link above for the Tracking Documentation, you will learn how to include the Javascript code on your pages, insert your API keys, and track visists.  The second part of the system is the  REST  API.  This API allows you to access functions, creating new customers, etc.  REST is easily accessible using most modern programming languages.  Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-orientated URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API eerrors.  In addition, valid  JSON  will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.  Please refer to our  API docs  for additional information.  It will have the latest documentation for all end points as the Refersion API is revised over time.  The third part of the system is  GraphQL .  GraphQL allows you view all of the data inside of the database.  The entire database of information is available to you.  See the  Overview  section below for additional information.",

Rather than construct several REST requests to fetch data that you\u2019re interested in, you can often make a single call to fetch the information you need. Additionally you can specify exactly which fields you want included in the response.  GraphQL is, above all, a querying language, and the format of the query you send matches the data you receive. The language has a schema that strongly types the exchange between client and server.",

GraphQL natively supports performing an introspection query which allows the API to more fully discoverable and easier to integrate against. The ability to define and specify precisely the data you want for your integration is a powerful advantage over the existing REST endpoints. Through fragments and template variables it simplifies many aspects of the client-side integration process. Additionally, because it\u2019s a recognized spec, there are many client libraries and tools to assist you in quickly getting up and running.",
