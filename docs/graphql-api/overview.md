# GraphQL Overview

    This is a Beta API and is subject to change.


## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a new way to think about building and querying APIs. Rather than construct several REST requests to pull data that youâ€™re interested in, you can fetch all the information you need in a single call. GraphQL allows you specify exactly which fields you need, making data querying more flexible and efficient than traditional REST APIs. 

Example request and response:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/graphql-response-animation.gif" alt="What you request is what you get" />
</div>

GraphQL is, above all, a querying language, and the format of the query you send matches the data you receive. The language has a schema that strongly ties the exchange between client and server.

We built GraphQL API to supplement our existing REST API, giving you more flexibility to get exactly the data you need.
