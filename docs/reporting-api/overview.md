# Overview

In order for Refersion to operate as expected, we must be able to capture your transactions. If you are not using a shopping cart platform that we already integrate with, you must implement our tracking solution on your web site manually. Our tracking isn't very complicated and is installed similiar to how Google Analytics is installed.

## Refersion API Keys

In order to successfully content with our servers, you must idenfity your account with your own unique Refersion API Public and/or Secret key. You may see existing or create new API keys right from your [API Settings](https://www.refersion.com/settings) page while logged in.

## How to Implement

### Step 1

Include a JavaScript code on every page on your site so that we can track your affiliate visits.

### Step 2

Report each order to us either on your "thank you" page as a JavaScript snippet or through a Webhook (preferred).
