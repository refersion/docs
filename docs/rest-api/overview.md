# REST API Overview

The Refersion API is organized around REST, which is easily accessible using most modern programming languages. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. In addition, valid JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.
