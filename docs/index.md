# Welcome to Refersion

Thank you for being a part of the Refersion developer community.  This isn't a simple referral tracking system.  Refersion is the most powerful Affiliate Program available and it is waiting for **you** to unlock that power.  With the **GraphQL API**, the entire database of information is at your fingertips.  You can track things, generate reports, and view all of the data Refersion has for your Affiliate program. 

There are three parts of the Refersion system:

The first is the [Tracking Documentation](https://www.refersion.com/tracking).  The Tracking Document shows you how to setup refersion  If you follow the link above for the Tracking Documentation, you will learn how to include the Javascript code on your pages, insert your API keys, and track visists.

The second part of the system is the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API.  This API allows you to access functions, creating new customers, etc.  REST is easily accessible using most modern programming languages.  Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-orientated URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API eerrors.  In addition, valid [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.  Please refer to our [API docs](https://www.refersion.com/api_docs/#introduction) for additional information.  It will have the latest documentation for all end points as the Refersion API is revised over time.

The third part of the system is [GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/).  GraphQL allows you view all of the data inside of the database.  The entire database of information is available to you.  See the [Overview](#overview) section below for additional information.
